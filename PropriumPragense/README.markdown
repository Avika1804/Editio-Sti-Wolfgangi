# Proprium Provinciae Pragensis ad Antiphonale Romanum #

Office chants for the proper feasts of the church province 
of Prague (Czech Republic) according to manuscripts available online
(at www.manuscriptorium.com). (Most probably they haven't ever been
printed as a whole.)

For "secular" (not monastic) office. Unlike the other materials I create.
(This is on the first place for me, not for the choir of my friends,
which sticks to monastic office.)

I'm doing my best to find chants conform to the texts of the
(pre-IInd Vatican) breviary.
But if there are any superfluous words in the manuscript,
I usually leave them on place and make a notice in the GABC file,
that the given line doesn't appear in the official texts of the breviary.
Otherwise the melody would be broken.

As I am no musicologist, the transcriptions are generally of very low
quality.

Each subdirectory contains files necessary to produce a form for one feast.
I don't provide any way to produce one booklet containing all of them.
(Because the project is in an early stage. Later I would like to produce a
"book" as a provincial supplement to the Antiphonale Romanum of 1912.)
