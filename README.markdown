# Editio S(anc)ti Wolfgangi #

Booklets for Roman Catholic liturgy (office + sometimes mass)
with gregorian chant. Some with Czech translations of the Latin
texts.

I prepare them for one specific choir, but maybe someone else can also
use them.

Each subdirectory beginning with an uppercase letter contains
one booklet. To compile it simply run 'rake' in that subdirectory.

To compile the booklets you will need:
* Ruby 1.9.* + rake
* gregorio (tested with gregorio 2.0)
* LuaLaTeX (tested with TeXLive 2012)
* Junicode font
