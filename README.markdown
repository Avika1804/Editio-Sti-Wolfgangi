# Editio S(anc)ti Wolfgangi #

See our Czech/Latin homepage:
http://stiwolfgangi.xf.cz

Booklets for Roman Catholic liturgy (office + sometimes mass)
with gregorian chant. Some with Czech translations of the Latin
texts.

Each subdirectory beginning with an uppercase letter contains
one ore more booklets. (Possibly in further subdirectories.) 
To compile it simply run 'rake' in that subdirectory.

To compile the booklets you will need:
* Ruby 1.9.* + rake
* gem [pslm](https://github.com/igneus/pslm)
* gregorio (tested with gregorio 2.0)
* LuaLaTeX (tested with TeXLive 2012)
* Junicode font

License: texts and chants are taken from liturgical books older than 70 years
(unless specified otherwise) and are thus (as long as I know) public domain.
