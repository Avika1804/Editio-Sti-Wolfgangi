# Series Conventus #

Booklets prepared for the choir "Conventus Choralis". Each booklet
contains office (and not always mass) chants for an occasion in the 
liturgical year, usually a solemnity or Sunday, according to the
Antiphonale Monasticum 1933.

As "Conventus Choralis" is sort of an offspring of 
"Choeur gregorien de Paris", the booklets follow established informal
standards of office booklets of the latter ensemble.
