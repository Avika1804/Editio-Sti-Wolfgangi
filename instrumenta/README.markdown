In this directory there are tools I often use in my workflow:
1. sort of "libraries" I include in the Rakefiles
2. standalone scripts automating some mechanical tasks during the typesetting

Some of the more useful scripts are documented and you may read
the documentation here:
http://stiwolfgangi.xf.cz/docs/

One of the tools is not included here, its psalmpreprocessor.rb .
You can find it in my other project "In adiutorium":
https://github.com/igneus/In-adiutorium/tree/master/nastroje
(And it's unfortunatelly not yet documented.)
