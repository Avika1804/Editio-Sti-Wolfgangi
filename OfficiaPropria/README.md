# Officia propria pro dioecesibus regni Bohemiae

An attempt to provide a *breviary* (without chant) appendix
with full texts for the feasts proper to the dioeceses of the Czech Republic -
first for the province of Prague, later possibly also for the province
of Olomouc.
The texts should be conform with the 1962 state of liturgical law
and typesetting compatible as much as possible with the
[Nova et Vetera breviary edition](http://www.breviariumromanum.com/).
